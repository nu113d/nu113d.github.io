Hi, my name is Vaggelis Stoikos, a guy who loves science but slightly more interested for computers. I started programming with Scratch at 12, tried C++ at 15 (failed!), and later learned [Processing](https://processing.org/), creating graphical games and physics simulations. At 18, I began university, where I studied computer science while joining the cybersecurity club, diving into CTFs, reverse engineering, and penetration testing. Today, I work as a DevOps engineer and plan to pursue a Master’s in electronic physics.
